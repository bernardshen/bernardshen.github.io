Jiacheng Shen is a final-year Ph.D. student from [ARISE Lab](http://ariselab.cse.cuhk.edu.hk/), Department of Computer Science and Engineering, The Chinese University of Hong Kong (supervised by [Prof. Michael R. Lyu](https://www.cse.cuhk.edu.hk/lyu/)). He received a B.Sc degree in Computer Science from Fudan Unversity in 2020 (supervised by [Prof. Yangfan Zhou](https://appsrv.cse.cuhk.edu.hk/~yfzhou/)). 

Jiacheng's research interests span distributed systems, data center resource disaggregation, and machine learning systems. He focuses on building high-performance and resource-efficient systems for next-generation data centers. His works have been published at top systems venues, including SOSP, OSDI, FAST, ICDCS, DSN, etc.
