### Ph.D./M.Phil./RA openings
I am looking for Ph.D./M.Phil. students and research assistants starting in 2025 spring/fall. Recently, I focus on designing efficient and reliable systems for large language model (LLM) training and inference.

Ph.D. and M.Phil. students will be co-supervised by [Prof. Pinjia He](https://pinjiahe.github.io/) at The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen (CUHK-SZ).

His work has been published at the top venues, e.g., ICSE, FSE, ASE, ISSTA, ICLR, OSDI, etc.

The normative period for Ph.D. is 5 years, and 2 years for M.Phil. Students will frist stay at CUHK-SZ to finish their required courses and then come to DKU. Full time scholarship will be provided. Upon graduation, students will be awarded a Ph.D. degree at The Chinese University of Hong Kong according to the current policies of CUHK-SZ.
