### Ph.D./M.Phil./RA openings
I am looking for Ph.D./M.Phil. students and research assistants starting in 2025 fall. Recently, I will mainly focus on designing efficient and reliable systems for large language model (LLM) training and inference.

Ph.D. and M.Phil. students will be co-supervised by [Prof. Pinjia He](https://pinjiahe.github.io/) at The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen. Pinjia He is an assistant professor and presidential young fellow at CUHKSZ. His work focuses on software engineering, systems, and programming languages. His work has been published at the top venues, e.g., ICSE, FSE, ASE, ISSTA, ICLR, OSDI, etc.

The normative period for Ph.D. is 5 years, and 2 years for M.Phil. Full time scholarship will be provided.

If you are interested in working with us and do impactful research, drop me an email (jcshen.dku@gmail.com) with the subject "{PhD\|MPhil\|RA}-{Your Name}" (*e.g.*, PhD-Jiacheng Shen) attached with your CV and transcripts.
